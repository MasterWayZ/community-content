<!-- This where the actual tutorial begins. You don't need to write out the title again, having it in the frontmatter above is enough. -->

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will be deploying VMware vCenter, configuring the appliance and adding our vSphere (ESXi) host to a datacenter so we can manage it.

There is also a video version of this tutorial available [here](YT URL HERE)

**Prerequisites**

..* A server with VMware vSphere (ESXi) installed. A tutorial on that can be found [here](URLHERE).
..* You will also need a VMware account in order to download the ISO required to install the vCenter Server Appliance.
..* An IP address for your vCenter server. This can either be a public IP address, or a private IP address from a router VM. (Do keep in mind that if you want to use a private IP, you will have to create a vmkernel NIC with Management access on the ESXi host connected to the same network as your vCenter Server will be.)

**Licensing**

The vCenter Server Appliance is not a free product. It will have a 60 day trial license when installed. If you want to continue to use it after that, you will need to [buy](https://store.vmware.com/store) a license.
More information on licensing can be found [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/10/vcenter-server-licensing-options.html).


## Step 1 - Deploying the vCenter Server Appliance

We have to download the vCenter Server Appliance ISO, mount it and install it. This is what we will be doing in this step.

First, download the vCenter Server Appliance ISO, you can download it from (here)[https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=742&rPId=22641&downloadGroup=VC67U2].
Select the most up-to-date version on the top, and then click on the blue Download Now button next to "VMware vCenter Server Appliance". You will have to login with your VMware account and click on the blue link to activate your VMware vSphere 6.7 trial.
Once you have downloaded the ISO, you have to mount it. In Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, simply double click on the ISO to mount it. In other versions, you will have to use a program such as (Virtual CloneDrive)[https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html].

When you have the ISO mounted, open the "vcsa-ui-installer" folder. If you are using Windows, open the "win32" folder. If you are using Mac, open the "mac" folder. For Windows, open "installer.exe".
This will open the deployment program. Click on Install. Click next, review the EULA and check the checkmark to accept them, then click on next again. For Deployment Type, selected Embedded Platform Services Controller and click on next.
For the deployment target, fill in the IP address or the FQDN of the server. For example: "esxi.example.com" or "203.0.113.2"
By default, the HTTPS port is 443, unless you changed it, leave it at 443. Then you fill in the username and password and click on next. You will get a prompt to verify the SSL certificate, click on yes.
Now we have to give the VM (Virtual Machine) a name and give it a root password. Fill in the VM name that you want, along with a root password and click on next.

For this step, we have to select a deployment size. There is a table shown with the maximum that each size can handle. Choose the size accordingly to what you will be using. When you have selected the correct size, click on next.
We need to select a datastore now. As you can see, there is an option to enable Thin Disk Mode. Essentialy, Thin Disk Mode creates the data virtual disk as Thin Provisioned, instead of the default Thick Provisioned. Thin Provisioned means that the virtual drive will be as large as the amount of data is stored on it. (For example, a 300GB virtual disk that has 70GB of data on it, will only be about 70 GB in size.) A Thick Provisioned virtual drive means that the drive will take up the full amount of space. (For example, a 300GB virtual disk that has 70GB of data on it, will be 300GB in size.)
When you have decided what mode to use and which datastore, click on next.

Now we have to configure the network settings, the settings will depend on what type of IP you wish to use. In case of a private IP, you can either choose DHCP or a static IP, depending on what you want. In the case of a public IP, you have to select DHCP on the assignment (this will help verify that the MAC address is correct later).

Click on next, review the settings and click on deploy. 

If you are using a private IP, continue to Step 2.

If you want to use a public IP for the vCenter Server Appliance, when it has finished deploying you will need to forcefully shutdown the VM, change the MAC address of the NIC to a MAC address that you request through the Robot console, and then have it power on. The catch is that your installer will be stuck at 80%. The solution for this is simple. Open up the console of your VM. After a while, it will give you a screen where it lists the IP address, hostname, CPU and memory. When you have reached that screen, press F2. Setup a root password, then when it has been set, press Escape and go to https://IP HERE:5480
Click on Configure, authenticate using the password that you set up during the installation process and continue with Step 2.
